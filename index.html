    <h4> Backstory</h4>
    <p>This is my li'l guy. He's a funny mosquito guy named Msqe (ponounced 'mos-kay') who drains souls, rather than blood.
        I made his concept over the summer, and did like 2 frames of animation before realizing i 
        was bad, and stopping. <br>

        I used this assignment as an opportunity to actually finish animating him. <br>

        This is just his abdomen opening up and closing. <br>
        
        There would be some souls releasing from it, but the way i made the sprite sheet, they 
        would have looked really ugly staying still when the abdomen was just open, which was
        something I didnt realize i wanted to do until after I had already made the spritesheet. <br>
        
        I still wanted to include the work that went into making them, so i threw them at the bottom. Just
        imagine them leaving the abdomen at some point while opening. 
    </p>

    <h4> Controls (?)</h4>
    <p> Bubbling animation: B <br>
        Opening animation: O <br>
        Closing animation: C <br>
        
        
        Hopefully you enjoy! I sure would if i could get it to work the way I wanted it to! :/
    </p>
    <h2>KNOWN BUGS: </h2>
        <p> I couldnt figure out how to get one animation to play right into another one. <br> 
            For some reason, the opening one also doesnt work.
